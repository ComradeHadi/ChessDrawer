ChessDrawer
===========

A simple Chess android application with a sliding navigation drawer present in the android support support library's latest revision 22

THe Navigation drawer is at http://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/nav-drawer.html

To access the navigation drawer just pull the screen from the edge of the left-hand-side of the screen or tap on the icon on the action bar.
The chess game is not complete and uses android's drag and drop features for the movement.

Update :

Added a widget for the game . Just add the widget on the home screen and it will show you the list of moves.
Added the database feature to the project. All the moves are getting saved to a particular database. 
Used a new ORM mapper called ActiveAndroid as a database manager. More info at : https://github.com/pardom/ActiveAndroid


TODO:
- Add the game LOGIC.
- Add some UI features
- Fix some bugs
